Before you read this, do the right thing and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYaDXZ2MI-k">the video "The Games Behind Your Government's Next War"</a> by People Make Games. It's what this is about.
</p><p>
Let me start off by saying thank you to People Make Games. They could've chosen any number of ways to present what they'd learned, and they threaded the needle between vapid presentation coverage that would've felt full of both-sides-ism and the tendency of outrage journalism to reduce this issue to something like "military bad" that, while probably justified, wouldn't capture any of the difficult moral connections involved. Kudos to all of you; I'm sure there were lots of tough conversations that went into producing that, and, like any good work of art, you're probably still feel like it's missing something. I want you to know what you made is deeply meaningful to me.
</p><p>
Now some background. In high school I was a nationally competitive foreign extemporaneous speaker, and (when I wasn't dreaming making video games or writing music for a living) I assumed my life's work would be to enter the policy sphere thinking about foreign affairs. At college I continued speech and debate and I spent a lot of time doing a double major (before eventually dropping it) in International Policy Studies. All this is not to say I'm an expert (far from it) but that I've thought about these issues for a really long time. Not longer than people who do it for a living, but longer than many game devs.
</p><p>
I also worked in the financial industry in high frequency trading for three years. I'm not gonna give a lot of detail on that in this post, but it is relevant later, so let's leave it here.
</p><p>
Now, to the meat of what I want to say:
</p><p>
Being human means being connected to your family, your friends, your coworkers, your society, your country, and the rest of humanity. The beauty of life lies in those interconnections, but those roles are different. My impact as a father is really different from my role as an American citizen or an employee of Magic Soup. Framing your thoughts that way can help when trying to sail through the gap between the Scylla of moral imperialism and the Charybdis of helpless despair.
</p><p>
Human intellect is powerful. We are creative and inventive, and given time, support, and resources, we can accomplish incredible things. The video mentions tampons and the Internet, and I'm not gonna try a laundry list, but of <i>course</i> when given lots of money and time creative humans are going to invent creative solutions to problems, and the most creative will have applications outside their original intents.
</p><p>
The first truth here is to realize that the framing of "is what I'm doing causing terrible things to happen" obscures the more important and consequential "why does our society spend so much time, support, and resources doing terrible things?" Knowledge, technique, science - these are mostly amoral. It is in the method of acquisition and the method of application that morality enters. Understanding something like how immersion affects player agency or the mechanics of press your luck mechanics is just knowledge, but acquiring them through desensitizing someone to exploitation or applying them to desensitize someone to atrocity are inherently immoral decisions.
</p><p>
The second truth is that, because of the nature of your connections, the way your morality affects the world is tied directly to your actions, not your output. This is true both for your limitations and, importantly, the limitations of the people you dramatically disagree with. The bad news: you cannot control the actions of others. The good news? They cannot control yours either.
</p><p>
Sometimes there are big decisions involved and you are very critical in the outputs of those decisions, like if you're an atomic scientist working on the Manhattan Project, but don't kid yourself - this happens all the time at all the levels of your human connection, and understanding that isn't a byproduct or an interesting side-note - it's the heart of living out your morality. 
</p><p>
I haven't told this story publicly, but let me explain how I decided to leave the financial industry.
</p><p>
One day I was sitting in our break room, and CNBC was on the TV. An ad came on for software that promised users could "trade like the pros" from your own home. An accomplished trader came in and watched the ad and got all giddy, yelling "yes, yes" at the TV. I commented that I was amused he was excited about home traders getting involved in competing in his space. His response still haunts me to this day:
</p><p>
"Kurtis, this isn't a game. They're chum in the pool. We make money every time one of those idiots throws their life savings into the market."
</p><p>
I reacted very badly to that statement. I got the usual defences of "if not us then somebody else will" and "they know what they're getting into" but finally where he ran was this:
</p><p>
"We don't take it all; we just take the first bite."
</p><p>
Now, my leaving the financial industry doesn't mean that's not true. Those people still exist. Further, his statement about the depth of the bench of the other team is ture: even if I could stop every single one, other people would find other ways to do similar things, and people with my skills would still help them for money. If I were to focus on the breadth of that problem it would paralyze me, whether inside or outside the financial industry.
</p><p>
But, my leaving the financial industry does mean that this particular man, whom I helped make more effective, is no longer able to utilize my skill, and his effectiveness is dependent on the immorality of others, not mine.
</p><p>
And that, I guess, is what I really want to say. Like the video says "Don't Turn Away". But also realize that the way you impact this issue might be much, much closer to home than proclaiming on social media: "don't use my work to kill people" (which, like, I hope everybody who reads this agrees with.) Bad people will do bad things even if you make it harder for them to do.
</p><p>
"Don't Turn Away" means being engaged at all levels, not just the abstract high level ones where you have the least impact, and from this thesis statement I want to say two things:
</p><p>
1. Influence what's around you. Be gracious to things that aren't immediately around you.
</p><p>
This might mean supporting a junior dev who's struggling. It might mean using your seniority or privileged race or gender to challenge your studio leadership on pay equity. It might mean steering a design away from desensitization to cruelty. It might mean focusing on being ecologically minded with data center footprint needs.
</p><p>
It also might mean engaging and support collective action. The favorite criminal of the game industry right now is the C-suite exec who makes bad planning decisions and as a result overextends their studios and teams and then lays off a ton of people but never suffers consequences themselves. Those people are convinced of the rightness of their approach. "Don't Look Away" could lead you to vacuous posting about the injustice of it all, or it could lead you to supporting ways to increase the size of your influence through joining with others to make your influence stronger in that decision making arena.
</p><p>
It might also mean getting politically involved. That's a whole different set of difficult, because you're going to end up making alliances with even larger, more unrelated groups of people, but despite being difficult, it's worth it for the changes you can bring, even if they're less than what you hoped for. That's a whole 'nother post for another time.
</p><p>
But it will <i>always mean something</i>. By definition, as a game dev, you are <b>not</b> powerless in this situation.
</p><p>
The tendency will be to look towards the industry-wide things, but be aware that is where you have the least ability to enact change. The danger here is to accept the moral burden for the immoral actions of others because you "don't do enough" to stop them. Now, obviously "Don't look away" cannot mean you ignore the terrible things and then just go about your life. But just as you can find terrible things everywhere, and worse, you bear some responsibility, regardless of who you are, for some truly terrible actions, the countertruth to this is that <b>you can find beautiful things everywhere</b>, and <b>you share some responsibility, regardless of who you are, with some truly magnificent accomplishments</b>.
</p><p>
I hope for many the illuminating part of that video is realizing that making a military decision maker more effective at making military decisions is a <i>really good thing</i> in the hands of a moral, ethical person who is tasked with making a military decision. The only way for that to be a false statement is if we can create a world (and we should be trying) where no military decisions are ever made, which is not our current, real world.
</p><p>
If you're a wargaming designer and you're helping a warmongering commander become more effective, that's not something you can hide in the veneer of the abstract - that is absolutely true. But for those who aren't wargaming designers, it's easy to sit back and throw stones on the internet by imagining that every single wargaming designer is being screwed by every single commander because that situation could exist. (Or replace commander with the aforementioned C-suite executive if you need something closer to home.) The real world is more complex than that, and I hope that watching this video people realize that they could be very, very far from wargaming and still be helping that industry, and that knowledge isn't ignored or obsessed over.
</p><p>
2. When you have agency, choose to go places where you can influence the things that matter.
</p><p>
This is largely why I am now at Magic Soup. There are not many game companies headed by women. When I left Blizzard and I was given the opportunities I was picking amongst, I decided a strong consideration should be "if I'm going to, by my skills, help a studio be successful, can I make it a studio headed by a woman?"
</p><p>
Some of you may watch the PMG video and go "you mean I can help influence global policy makers?" Yes, you absolutely can. Becoming a wargaming designer may at times be morally uncomfortable, for all the reasons given in the video. But deciding to avoid that world deliberately means your influence will never be felt there. Yes, you have to be careful you aren't the person supporting the warmongerer. But you also don't want the only people the warmongerer ever hears from being other warmongerers.
</p><p>
I am under no illusion that this choice is morally easy. Like I said at the beginning, there are so, so many examples of absolutely awful things that the western world (and especially the US) has done with its military. But it is a place of privileged naivety that says "I will simply not be involved." You are already involved. Your work and creativity and skill will be seen, used, and repackaged by those who are exposed to it - some of whom will be the worst kinds of humans you can imagine. You do not have to accept the guilt of their immortal decisions, but your influence will not be minimized by your decision to choose to not engage.
</p><p>
Finally, also realize that just like they can misuse your work - you, the talented, creative game dev you are, can use their time, support, and resources to make something good and powerful that, to them, might be just as terrible. They may reinterpret something meant for good into evil, but you can reinterpret something meant for evil into good.
</p><p>
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to use whatever influence you have with where you are to make the world a better place. This is the great horror and great glory of being human - we ultimately remake our world in our image. Don't leave that power in the hands of the worst people on earth out of a false sense of moral superiority. Instead, move through life constantly making things better and paying forward all that's been done for you.
</p><p>
I believe in you.
